# Mous Front End Developer task 2

## Setup:
- Clone the repo.
- Use whichever tools you like for developing.

## Task:
- We would like you to write the HTML and CSS to replicate the device picker design attached, try and match the design as closely as possible. *(ignore the Mous website in the background, it's just a placeholder)*.
- You're encouraged to use SCSS instead of CSS.
- Provide a Github link with a live URL.

## Bonus points:
- Structuring your CSS using BEM.
- Using JS to control the model selector slider (welcome to use a library).
- SEO friendly markup.

Good luck and feel free to get in contact if you have any questions.
